            <p class="card-text text-muted">History of Amparo High School It was in 1970 when the community of Amparo subdivision realized its need to have an institution for education at the secondary level in their area. During that year, Tala High School and Bagong Silang High School were the nearest public high schools. The local folks faced a great problem in reaching these schools because of their remoteness and inaccessibility, especially during the rainy season when the uncemented roads turn into mud. As a response to this problem, the officials of the barangay decided to ask for help from the local government of Caloocan. The request was granted. Six dilapidated academic rooms were constructed on the grounds of Amparo Elementary School. The newly established school was then an annex of Caloocan High School.</p>

            <p class="card-text text-muted">The division officials designated Mrs. Estelita Reyes as its first school head from 1979 to 1982. Because of its fast-growing population, the school officials were forced to convert the two comfort rooms into classrooms and teachers held their classes even under the shed of trees. Mrs. Aurora Sanglap took the office as school head from 1982 to 1988. In her administration, the problem of congestion of students in a classroom was very much evident. The school administration decided to seek help from the local folks around the community. In 1988, a generous philanthropist donated a part of her real estate property to be the new site of Amparo High School. She is DNA. Amparo francisco, a selfless widow who munificently donated one hectare of land which is located at Marang St. Amparo subdivision. At this point, the annex school got its independence. In 1988, a Filipino teacher from Talipapa High School assumed the position of school head of the newest secondary school in Caloocan City. Mrs. Dedicacion S. Alacon was assigned to spearhead the development of the institution. The first building that was constructed was the Carino’s building. It has eight academic rooms including the administration offices. The rooms of the building did not suffice the demands of the school’s academic needs. The new school head did not take for granted the problem. She moved and took the necessary action. She solicited help from both local and national offices. The request was granted.</p>

            <p class="card-text text-muted">It was in June 22, 2005 when Amparo High School’s faculty and students bid goodbye to Dr. Florida v. Magdato and welcomed its new administrator. A former mathematics teacher from NHC High School was promoted as a master teacher in that school, served as school head of MLQ High School for less than 3 years, and later went back to NHC High School as a secondary school principal and served there for less than five years.

Mrs. Aquino introduced some changes in the system and policies of the school trying it to be productive, practical and progress-bound. It was in her administration when the computer literacy program was given free. Her support encourages not only the teacher but also the students thus, it resulted in winning contests and exceptional awards up to the national level. Despite the fact that her first priority is academic excellence, the physical aspect of the school is not left behind. It was in her administration that the following improvements were made: tle laboratory was renovated making it functional laboratory and a learning area as well.
              Renovation of the administration building gives a place for emis where school records are kept and school communications and reports are prepared.
              It was in the same administration when the social studies learning center was completed. It is now a functional learning center and a mini museum at the same time. Two comfort rooms that were not functioning were converted into a guidance office and clinic. Rehabilitation of a comfort room was made for teachers’ use a comfort room that was not functioning was converted into a teachers’ nook where teachers can keep their personal belongings and where they can prepare their reports and teaching aids.
